# Angular-SpringBoot

# This project demonstrate how to use Spring-Boot framework as backend Tools and Angular framework as frontend Tools
#
I created the database model myself. This is just for learning how to use Spring-boot with Angular.
I didn't want to try the basic examples or tutorial but something different, which I thought up myself and implement new ideas. 
In the end it is important what you have learned and not what you have tried.

##
if anyone has any ideas for improving the project, please email me at a-hage@hotmail.de.
